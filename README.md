# Description

It all began with a break in. Then a second.

By the time the sixth occurred, I was completely fed up - the police didn't care, and my car looked like it was shambles. It's not like I kept anything important in there - I'm a student for goodness sake! But the fact that they somehow hit up my car in the middle of the night when the alarm was set and no one had noticed anything was beyond me.

The annoyance I felt only vanished when a car alarm down the street went off.

I groaned and threw a pillow over my face. "Will it never end, can't they just shut it off?" I thought.

Wait a minute. My own reaction told me all I need to know: we, living in an urban center, are completely desensitized to car alarms. We assume that they go off for no other reason than to annoy your neighbors, or when accidentally popping the trunk to our own cars without turning off the alarm first. Yes, the car alarm started as a beneficial thing - highly prized, but how many hail storms leave us feeling miffed from the cacophony of noise?

Enter Sentinel.

Sentinel is the solution for the modern car alarm. It's silent.

"Silent," you say, "Ha! How on Earth would that help? May as well hand over the keys right now!"

Well, why not hand me your phone instead? You see, Sentinel is always with you. Your car's protection rests in your own hands. One click, and you can sleep in ease knowing you will be informed of a problem only when we sense your car door is being opened - without you nearby.

Give us a try - we're positive you'll trust your car's security to Sentinel.
